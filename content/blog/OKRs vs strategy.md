# OKRs vs strategy

In Good Strategy/Bad Strategy, chapter 3 opens with a definition and background about 'bad strategy', which is not just the absence of good strategy. Instead, it's about the misapplication of effort or other things masquerading as strategy. In the context of military strategy from the US in the 2000s, it refers to a "basic confusion between strategy and goals". That got me thinking about OKRs, which I've also been reading up on lately. 

OKRs could easily fall into this definition of bad strategy: a set of objectives with measurable key results, but used alone they aren't a substitute for strategic planning. 

It begs the question: do you have the right strategy in place to be able to define what your OKRs need to be? Most of the literature around OKRs focuses plenty on what a good or bad definition of an OKR is and there are shared ideas about making sure the objective and key results work toward a desirable outcome but there could definitely be more time spent on the strategy work required upfront to point them in the right direction.
